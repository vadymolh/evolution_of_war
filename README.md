Turn-based strategy (TBS) game

Detailed description in file `game_concept.txt`

Initial draft is going to be written in Python 3.x, using Pygame

The main idea: create game which doesn't require powerful computers and can introduce exciting gameplay.
Inspired by good old games: Master of Orion, Heroes Of Might and Magic, X-COM, Civilization and others.

Game will be an open-source project forever, I hope.
Any help will be appreciated, collaboration is welcome!...
